## Git exercise : Reordering history

The commits here have obviously been made by a mad man.
Unfortunately they actually contain useful information - it's just that the history is weird.
You should fix this such that our `git log` looks great!

## Setup


echo "initial" > foo.txt
git add foo.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git tag -m 'Start' START
git push origin master
git push origin START

echo "1" > file1
git add file1
git commit -m "file1"

echo "9" > file9
git add file9
git commit -m "file9"


## Task

Reorder the history such that it actually makes sense - add the files in the order that matches their name.

1. Use `git log --oneline --graph` to view the commits
2. Also try `git reflog` to view the commits. `git reflog` defaults to `git reflog show` and this is an alias for `git log -g --abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline`
3. Use `git rebase -i <after-this-commit>` to reorder the commits. There are commments in the file you edit that explain the commands available.
4. Use `git log --oneline --graph` to view the result

### useful commands

- `git rebase -i <after-this-commit>`
- `git log --oneline --graph`
- `git reflog`
